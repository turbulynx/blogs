## NLP Tasks
- **Language Modelling** : Predict the next word based on the sequence of words that already occurs in a given language. Application: speech recognition, OCR Translation etc.
- **Text classification** : Assigning a text into one of the known categories based on content. Application: Email spam, sentiment analysis etc
- **Information Extraction** : Extracting important information from a text. Application: extracting user's intent from input text, calendar etc.
- **Information Retrieval** : Finding data based on user query. Application: Used in search engine.
- **Conversational Agent** : A Dialogue system that can converse in a human language. Application: Siri, Alexa etc.
- **Text Summarization** : Short summary of longer documents by retaining the important information. Application: Summary report generation from social media information.
- **Question Answering** : Automatically answer questions posted in Natural Language. Application: Answering a user query based on data from a database.
- **Machine Translation** : Converting a piece of text from one to another language. Application: Google transalator
- **Topic Modelling** : Uncover the topical structure of large collection of text. Application: Text Mining

## Understanding Human language and its building blocks
- **Language**: words used in a Structured and conventional way and used to convey an idea by speech, writing or gesture.
- **Linguistics**: Scientific study of a language and its structure. Study of language grammer, syntax and phonitics.
  - Building Blocks:
    - Phonemes: smallest unit of speech & sound. English language has 44 of them. Applications: Speech to text transcriptions and text to speech conversations.
    - morphemes and lexemes: Applications: Tokenization, Stemming, lemmatization, word embedding, parts of speech tagging.
       - morphemes: smallest unit of a word. not all morphemes are words but the prefixes and suffixes are. e.g. 'multi' in multistory.
       - lexemes: basic building block of a language. dictionary entries are lexems. lexemes are built on basic form e.g. walk, walking, walked.
 - **Syntax**: arragnement of words in a sentence. Representation of sentence is done using parse tree. Entity Extraction and relation extraction.
    - syntax - phrases and sentences
    - context - meaning
